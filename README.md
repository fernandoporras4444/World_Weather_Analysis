# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview:
The project was use API data retieval process and build that into a trip planning process overlaying marker points with weather information.

## Results:
Through the use of Jupyter Notebook I was able to create a planned trip and decide my trip location based on temperature input I perferred to enjoy. The process of creating a travel destination map and travel itinerary map gives me more ideas for future use in reporting based on end user inputs.
